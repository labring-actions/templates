# Plane

## Overview

Open Source JIRA, Linear, Monday, and Asana Alternative. Plane helps you track your issues, epics, and product roadmaps in the simplest way possible.

This Sealos template deploys **Plane** as the `plane` application. It uses the repository-maintained Sealos manifest and keeps deployment, networking, and storage configuration inside the template.

## Deploy on Sealos

Open this template in the Sealos App Store, review the configuration values, and click **Deploy**. Sealos renders the template variables, creates the required Kubernetes resources, and manages the public endpoint for the application.

## Access

After deployment, open `https://${{ defaults.app_host }}.${{ SEALOS_CLOUD_DOMAIN }}`. The concrete hostname is generated from `defaults.app_host` and your Sealos Cloud domain.

## Configuration

The following user-facing inputs are available during deployment:

This template does not define extra user inputs; the default settings are enough to deploy it.

Keep sensitive values in Sealos-managed inputs or generated defaults. Do not commit private credentials to the template repository.
